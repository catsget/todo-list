## Todo list
This Simple CLI based todo-list with some customization

## Installation

I recommend launch with python for max performance, but you can launch binary file for win64 or linux64
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```
or
### Linux
#### Launch
```
todo_list_linux64
```
### Windows
